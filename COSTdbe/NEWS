		CHANGES IN COSTdbe VERSION 1.0

NEW FEATURES
    o 'alkLgthRec' has been updated : 'sExtrGrp', 'lExtrGrp' and 'sFillAge' types are removed, and virtual individuals in output object are created from recorded individuals duplication. 
    o for 'type="stepIncr"' in 'alkLgthRec' method, a 'start' parameter can be specified to define the minimal length class after recoding. 
    o 'stratAggreg' has been updated : weighted means calculations are made for biological parameters estimates. 
    o 'bpEstim' has been updated : adjustment can be made within total length distribution ('lenStruc$estim' slot) in a 'dbeOuptut' object 
DOCUMENTATION 
BUG FIXES		
    o virtual individuals are not considered anymore in 'nMeas' slot from 'dbeOutput' object
    o subset on catch category has been added in 'RaiseLgth' method 

		CHANGES IN COSTdbe VERSION 0.1-9

NEW FEATURES
    o in 'dbeCalc', negative bounds are replaced by 0 in output object.
    o new 'stratAggreg' method for 'dbeOutput' object. Computes an aggregation (sum of 'value' field) of various 'dbeOutput' tables over specified stratification. 
    o new 'makeICfile' and 'makeICdf' functions. Convert COST dbeOutput object to InterCatch Exchange Format file. 
DOCUMENTATION
    o 'stratAggreg' and 'InterCatch' help files added.  
BUG FIXES		
    o a bug in 'dbeCalc' concerning '$DCRcvIndicator' calculation from estimates was fixed.

		CHANGES IN COSTdbe VERSION 0.1-8

NEW FEATURES
    o 'nMes' slot name in 'dbeOutput' object changed to 'nMeas'
    o 'nSamp' and 'nMeas' slots in 'dbeOutput' object are now a list with 2 elements : 
        oo $len is a data.frame with 4 fields ('time', 'space', 'technical' and 'value')
        oo $age is a data.frame with 3 fields ('time', 'space' and 'value').
    o in 'lenNum', 'ageNum', 'totalNnum' and 'totalWnum' slots, a new numeric element '$DCRcvIndicator' was added. 
      It is a global value of '$cv' values weighted by corresponding '$estim' values.
    o '$DCRcvIndicator' is now calculated along with '$cv' by 'dbeCalc' function.
